# spring-boot-app-mini-casino-game
Just simple web application. It hosts on localhost:8081 and allows you to play 3 games (And even to die! :O ).
Application is easy to start. You need just to run the main method of SpringBootAppApplication class.
It uses in-memory. Thats why you don't need to change nothing in the app before start.

(Also make sure that port 8081 is free)
