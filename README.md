ATTENTION!!!
Branch https://github.com/NikitaMor156/spring-boot-app-mini-casino-game/tree/With_in-memory_database uses in-memory database. It means that in this case you can run app without any additional configurations. (Just start the main method of SpringBootAppApplication class and and go to URL localhost:8081 in your browser and enjoy)

This is my web application which simulates casino games. It hosts on localhost:8081 and allows you to play 4 games (And even to die! :O ).
Application is easy to start. You need just to run the main method of SpringBootAppApplication class and go to URL localhost:8081 in your browser.

(Also make sure that the port 8081 of your PC is free)
