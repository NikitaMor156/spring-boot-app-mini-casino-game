spring-boot-app-mini-casino-game
Just simple web application. It hosts on localhost:8081 and allows you to play 4 games (And even to die! :O ).
Application is easy to start. You need just to run the main method of SpringBootAppApplication class and go to URL localhost:8081 in your browser.
It uses in-memory database. Thats why you don't need to change nothing in the app before start.

(Also make sure that port 8081 is free)
